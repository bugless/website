# Bugless Development Manifesto

1. Every bug stems from a line of code. Every line of code is written deliberately by a programmer. Therefore, every bug is created deliberately by a programmer.

2. A programmer must not write buggy code.

3. Sporadic unexpected features are intrinsic to buglessly developed projects.

4. ?

5. ?

6. What you think is a bug is not a bug. It is an opportunity for a feature.
